Firefly — Advanced Disaster Detection & Evacuation System

Firefly is designed to detect emergencies in real time, navigate people to safe exits, manage crowd flow, and assist emergency services during disasters.

⸻

Overview

Firefly provides a unified solution for emergency management, integrating:
	•	Real-time hazard detection via IoT sensors
	•	Intelligent evacuation routing
	•	Crowd management and congestion reduction
	•	Integration with emergency services for faster response

This system ensures faster, safer evacuations, reduces human error during crises, and empowers responders with actionable insights.

⸻

Problem Statement

Traditional emergency systems face challenges:
	•	Delayed hazard detection
	•	Inefficient evacuation routing leading to congestion
	•	Lack of real-time data for emergency responders
	•	Inadequate notifications to affected individuals

Firefly addresses these challenges by delivering a proactive, automated, and intelligent disaster management platform.

Key Use Cases

Use Case	Description
Building Evacuations	Calculates and displays optimal exit routes during emergencies.
Public Spaces	Manages crowd flow in large venues, airports, and stations.
Multi-Hazard Detection	Detects earthquakes, floods, fires, gas/chemical leaks, and security threats.
Emergency Response	Provides responders with real-time location and hazard data.

Features
	•	Real-Time Emergency Detection — Continuous monitoring using IoT sensors.
	•	Optimal Evacuation Routing — Calculates nearest safe exits dynamically.
	•	Crowd Management — Prevents congestion during mass evacuations.
	•	Emergency Service Integration — Provides live situational data to first responders.
	•	Alerts & Notifications — Push notifications, SMS alerts, and dashboard updates.

Architecture

High-Level Flow:

[IoT Sensors] → [Local Processing Node] → [Cloud Analytics & Routing] → [Dashboards / User Devices / Emergency Services]

Components:
	1.	IoT Sensors – Detect environmental hazards (fire, smoke, gas, motion).
	2.	Local Node – Aggregates sensor data, performs preliminary analysis.
	3.	Cloud Backend – Executes predictive analytics, pathfinding, and alert distribution.
	4.	Dashboards / Devices – Displays evacuation paths, hazard status, and notifications.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
	•	Python 3.11+
	•	Node.js 18+
	•	Docker (optional)
	•	Connected IoT sensors

Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sai-Deepan/firefly
cd firefly
```
Backend Setup:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
Frontend Setup:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Connecting Sensors: Connect your IoT sensors to the backend to enable real-time hazard detection. The system automatically calculates evacuation routes and notifies users and responders.

Usage Example

from firefly import EvacuationSystem

# Initialize system
system = EvacuationSystem(sensor_config="config.json")

# Start monitoring hazards
system.start_monitoring()

# Get optimal route for a location
route = system.calculate_route(current_location="Room 101")
print("Evacuation route:", route)

Visual Guides

Evacuation Flow Example:

Sensor detects hazard → Backend computes optimal exit → Dashboard displays routes → Notifications sent → Emergency services updated

Crowd Management Illustration:
	•	Routes dynamically adjust to prevent congestion
	•	Emergency services receive live updates
