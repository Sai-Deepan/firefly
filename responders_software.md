1. **Live Incident Command Dashboard**

   * Single real-time view:

     * Hazard type & severity
     * Affected zones
     * Active incidents
   * Clear priority ranking (what kills first shows first)

2. **Real-Time Indoor/Outdoor Mapping**

   * Floor-wise building maps
   * Live hazard overlays (fire, smoke, gas, heat)
   * Color-coded risk zones

3. **Victim & Responder Location Tracking**

   * Live positions of:

     * Civilians (opt-in / anonymized)
     * Response teams
   * Last-known-location persistence if signal drops

4. **Automated Incident Classification**

   * Fire / gas / structural / chemical / security
   * ML-driven severity scoring
   * Eliminates human delay in decision-making

## Operational Intelligence

5. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**

   * Suggests:

     * Which team to send
     * From where
     * Through which route
   * Adapts as conditions change

6. **Evacuation Status Monitoring**

   * Number evacuated / trapped / unknown
   * Bottleneck detection in exits and stairwells

7. **Predictive Hazard Spread**

   * Fire propagation
   * Smoke flow
   * Gas diffusion
   * Time-to-critical estimates

---

## Communication & Coordination

8. **Unified Communication Hub**

   * Text + voice + alerts
   * Works across agencies (fire, police, medical)
   * One source of truth

9. **Two-Way Civilian Messaging**

   * Push instructions directly to affected users
   * Receive SOS, medical info, mobility constraints

10. **Responder Safety Alerts**

    * Warns teams entering:

      * Collapse-risk zones
      * Toxic environments
      * Flashover-prone areas

---

## Decision Support & Automation

11. **AI-Assisted Decision Engine**

    * Recommends actions:

      * Evacuate vs contain
      * Zone lockdown
      * Ventilation control
    * Human approves, system executes

12. **Building System Control**

    * Remote:

      * Unlock exits
      * Shut gas
      * Activate smoke exhaust
      * Control elevators (ground-lock)

13. **Scenario Replay & Simulation**

    * Replay incidents for training
    * Run “what-if” simulations during live events

---

## Reliability & Compliance

14. **Offline & Degraded Mode**

    * Local command node fallback
    * Syncs when connectivity returns

15. **Audit Logs & Evidence Capture**

    * Immutable logs
    * Sensor data + timeline
    * Legal & post-incident review ready

---

## Post-Incident Intelligence

16. **After-Action Reports (Auto-Generated)**

    * Timeline
    * Decisions made
    * Outcomes
    * Failures

17. **System Learning Loop**

    * Incident data feeds ML models
    * Improves future predictions automatically

---

## Killer Differentiators

### 🔥 **“Digital Twin Command Mode”**

* Live building twin with:

  * Hazards
  * People
  * Routes
* Responders operate *inside* the model, not outside it

### ⚠️ **“Time-to-Death Metrics”**

* Estimates survivability windows
* Forces correct prioritization under pressure

To do first
1. Live hazard map
2. Victim location + SOS feed
3. Evacuation status
4. Resource routing
5. Responder safety alerts
